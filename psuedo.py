"""Ideas for smaller more manageable version."""



# Create base class for armor
# Create three types (light, heavy, cap)

# Create arena
# Create scripts where that allows user to fight or use items etc.
# Can use built in python methods and functions like random and other things

###### Make smaller and manageable so it be added to repo and used...
###### Could advance later with elements of pygame
